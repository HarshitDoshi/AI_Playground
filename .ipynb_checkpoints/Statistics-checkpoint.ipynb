    "* **Observational studies**: Here, in observational studies, the data is collected in a way that it does not interfere with how the data arises or is generated. Here, just observation is carried out. These types of studies only establish association. They are of two types:\n",

    "\n",

    "\n",
    "**Confounding variables** are extraneous variables that affect both, the *explanatory variable* and the *response variable*. This makes it seem like there is a relationship between them, while there actually isn't any.\n",

    "\n",
    "For example: When making soup, it is examined for taste. This is exploratory analysis. Then if the soup isn't salty enough, we infer that it needs salt. Here, we do not consume a whole part of soup to analyse and infer the taste of the soup, but instead, we just take a spoonful of it. This spoonful of soup is the representative sample. Here, the representative sample can be a spoonful of *stirred soup* or *unstirred soup*. Unstirred soup will probably not give a good idea of taste as the salt might not have mixed up.\n",
    "\n",
    "## A few sources of sampling bias\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Convenience sample**: Includes individuals who are easily accessible and are more likely to be included in the sample.\n",
    "* **Non-responese**: If only a (non-random) fraction of the randomly sampled people respond to a survey such that the sample is no longer representative of the population.\n",
    "* **Voluntary response**: Occurs when the sample consists of people who volunteer to respond because they have strong opinions on the issue.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Sampling methods\n",
    "\n",
    "1) **Simple Random Sampling (SRS)** - Here, each case is equally likely to be selected.\n",
    "\n",
    "2) **Stratified Sampling** - The population is divided into homogeneous strata and then random sampling is carried out from within each stratum.\n",
    "\n",
    "3) **Cluster Sampling** - The population is divided into clusters and a few of these clusters are randomly sampled. Then all the observations within these clusters are sampled.\n",
    "\n",
    "4) **Multistage Sampling** - Here, the population is divided into clusters. Then, a few of these clusters are randomly sampled. Then, random sampling is carried out within these clusters."
